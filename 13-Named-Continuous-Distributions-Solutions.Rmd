## Homework  


For problems 1-3 below, **_1)_** define a random variable that will help you answer the question, **_2)_** state the distribution and parameters of that random variable; **_3)_** determine the expected value and variance of that random variable, and **_4)_** use that random variable to answer the question. 

### Problem 1

On a given Saturday, suppose vehicles arrive at the USAFA North Gate according to a Poisson process at a rate of 40 arrivals per hour. 

a. Find the probability no vehicles arrive in 10 minutes. 

$X$: number of vehicles that arrive in 10 minutes

$X\sim \textsf{Pois}(\lambda=40/6=6.67)$ and $\E(X)=\Var(X)=6.67$. 

$\Prob(\mbox{no arrivals in 10 minutes})=\Prob(X=0)=\frac{6.67^0 e^{-6.67}}{0!}=e^{-6.67}$
```{r hw11a}
exp(-40/6)
##or
dpois(0,40/6)
```

or, using the exponential distribution:

$Y$: time in minutes until the next arrival

$Y\sim \textsf{Expon}(\lambda=40/60=0.667)$ and $\E(Y)=1.5$ and $\Var(Y)=2.25$. 

$$
\Prob(\mbox{at least 10 minutes until the next arrival})=\Prob(Y\geq 10)=\int_{10}^\infty \frac{2}{3}e^{-\frac{2}{3}y}\diff y
$$
```{r hw11b}
1-pexp(10,2/3)
```

or using simulation:

```{r}
set.seed(616)
mean(rpois(100000,40/6) == 0)
```

```{r}
mean(rexp(100000,2/3) >=10)
```



b. Find the probability that at least 5 minutes will pass before the next arrival.

$Y$: same as in part a

$$
\Prob(\mbox{at least 5 minutes until next arrival})=\Prob(Y\geq 5)=\int_{5}^\infty \frac{2}{3}e^{-\frac{2}{3}y}\diff y
$$

```{r}
1-pexp(5,2/3)
```

c. Find the probability that the next vehicle will arrive between 2 and 10 minutes from now. 

Same $Y$ as defined above. 
```{r hw11d}
pexp(10,2/3)-pexp(2,2/3)
```

d. Find the probability that at least 7 minutes will pass before the next arrival, given that 2 minutes have already passed. Compare this answer to part (b). This is an example of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution.
$$
\Prob(Y\geq 7|Y\geq 2) = \frac{\Prob(Y\geq 7, Y\geq 2)}{\Prob(Y\geq 2)} = \frac{\Prob(Y\geq 7)}{\Prob(Y\geq 2)}
$$

```{r hw11e}
(1-pexp(7,2/3))/(1-pexp(2,2/3))
```

This is the same answer and a result of the memoryless property.

e. Fill in the blank. There is a probability of 90% that the next vehicle will arrive within __ minutes. This value is known as the 90% percentile of the random variable. 
```{r hw11f}
qexp(0.9,2/3)
```

f. Use the function `stripplot()` to visualize the arrival of 30 vehicles using a random sample from the appropriate exponential distribution. 

```{r}
set.seed(202)
stripplot(cumsum(rexp(30,2/3)),xlab="Arrival Time")
```

### Problem 2

Suppose time until computer errors on the F-35 follows a Gamma distribution with mean 20 hours and variance 10.  

a. Find the probability that 20 hours pass without a computer error. 

$X$: time in hours until next computer error. 

$X\sim \textsf{Gamma}(\alpha = 40, \lambda = 2)$

We need to find $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ from the given moments.

$\E(X) = 20 = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda}$

$\Var(X) = 10 = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda^2}$

Notice that $\frac{\E(X)}{\Var(X)} = \lambda = \frac{20}{10}=2$ and then using $\E(X) = 20 = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda}$ we get $\alpha = 40$.  

$\Prob(X\geq 20)$:
```{r hw11k}
1-pgamma(20,shape=40,rate=2)
```

b. Find the probability that 45 hours pass without a computer error, given that 25 hours have already passed. Does the memoryless property apply to the Gamma distribution? 
$$
P(X\geq 45|X\geq 25) = \frac{P(X\geq 45, X\geq 25)}{P(X\geq 25)} = \frac{P(X\geq 45)}{P(X\geq 25)}
$$
```{r hw11l}
(1-pgamma(45,40,2))/(1-pgamma(25,40,2))
```

No, the memoryless property does not apply to the Gamma distribution. 

c. Find $a$ and $b$ where there is a 95% probability that the time until next computer error will be between $a$ and $b$. (Note: technically, there are many answers to this question, but find $a$ and $b$ such that each tail has equal probability.) 

```{r}
qgamma(c(0.025,0.975),40,2)
```
So in the time interval $[14,29,26.66]$.

```{r}
qgamma(.95,40,2)
```
Another answer is between $[0,25,47]$.

### Problem 3

Suppose PFT scores in the cadet wing follow a normal distribution with mean 330 and standard deviation 50. 

a. Find the probability a randomly selected cadet has a PFT score higher than 450. 

$X$: PFT score of a randomly selected cadet

$X\sim \textsf{Norm}(\mu=330,\sigma=50)$ 

$\E(X) = 330$ and $\Var(X)=50^2=2500$. 

```{r hw11g}
1-pnorm(450,330,50)
```

b. Find the probability a randomly selected cadet has a PFT score within 2 standard deviations of the mean.

Need $\Prob(230 \leq X \leq 430)$. 

```{r hw11h}
pnorm(430,330,50)-pnorm(230,330,50)
```

c. Find $a$ and $b$ such that 90% of PFT scores will be between $a$ and $b$. 

Need $a$ such that $\Prob(X\leq a)=0.05$ and $b$ such that $\Prob(X\geq b)=0.05$:
```{r hw11i}
qnorm(0.05,330,50)
qnorm(0.95,330,50)
```

d. Find the probability a randomly selected cadet has a PFT score higher than 450 given he/she is among the top 10% of cadets. 

Need $\Prob(X>450|X>x_{0.9})$ where $x_{0.9}$ is the 90th percentile of $X$. 

The 90th percentile is:

```{r}
qnorm(0.9,330,50)
```


$$
\Prob(X>450|X>x_{0.9})=\frac{\Prob(X>450, X>x_{0.9})}{\Prob(X>x_{0.9})}=\frac{\Prob(X>450, X>394.08)}{\Prob(X>x_{0.9})}=\frac{\Prob(X>450)}{0.1}
$$

This is assuming that $x_{0.9}<450$. Otherwise the problem is trivial and the probability is 1. 
```{r}
(1-pnorm(450,330,50))/0.1
```

### Problem 4

Let $X \sim \textsf{Beta}(\alpha=1,\beta=1)$. Show that $X\sim \textsf{Unif}(0,1)$. Hint: write out the beta distribution pdf where $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=1$.

The beta pdf is:
$$
f_X(x)=\frac{\Gamma(\alpha + \beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}
$$

When $X\sim\textsf{Beta}(\alpha=1,\beta=1)$, this becomes:
$$
f_X(x)=\frac{\Gamma(2)}{\Gamma(1)\Gamma(1)}x^{1-1}(1-x)^{1-1} = 1
$$

### Problem 5

When using `R` to calculate probabilities related to the gamma distribution, we often use `pgamma`. Recall that `pgamma` is equivalent to the cdf of the gamma distribution. If $X\sim\textsf{Gamma}(\alpha,\lambda)$, then
$$
\Prob(X\leq x)=\textsf{pgamma(x,alpha,lambda)}
$$

The `dgamma` function exists in `R` too. In plain language, explain what `dgamma` returns. I'm not looking for the definition found in `R` documentation. I'm looking for a simple description of what that function returns. Is the output of `dgamma` useful? If so, how? 

The `dgamma` function returns the value of probability density function. While this is not a probability, it is still a useful quantity. It can be said that larger densities ($f(x)$) imply that values near $x$ are more likely to occur than values associated with smaller densities. It is also useful when computing conditional probability distributions.

### Problem 6

Advanced. You may have heard of the 68-95-99.7 rule. This is a helpful rule of thumb that says if a population has a normal distribution, then 68% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the data will be within two standard deviations and 99.7% of the data will be within three standard deviations. Create a function in `R` that has two inputs (a mean and a standard deviation). It should return a vector with three elements: the probability that a randomly selected observation from the normal distribution with the inputted mean and standard deviation lies within one, two and three standard deviations. Test this function with several values of the `mu` and `sd`. You should get the same answer each time. 

```{r}
rulethumb<-function(mu,sd){
  pnorm(mu+c(1,2,3)*sd,mu,sd)-pnorm(mu-c(1,2,3)*sd,mu,sd)
}
```


```{r}
rulethumb(15,12)
```


```{r}
rulethumb(0,1)
```

### Problem 7

Derive the mean of a general uniform distribution, $U(a,b)$.

From the definition

$$E(X)=\int_{a}^{b}xf(x)dx=$$
$$ =\int_{a}^{b}\frac{x}{b-a}dx =$$

$$ =\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}xdx = \frac{1}{b-a}\cdot\frac{x^2}{2}\bigg|_{a}^{b}=$$

$$ =\frac{1}{b-a}\cdot\frac{b^2-a^2}{2}= \frac{1}{b-a}\cdot\frac{(b-a)(b+a)}{2}=\frac{(b+a)}{2}$$
